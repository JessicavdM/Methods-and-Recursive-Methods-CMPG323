# Methods-and-Recursive-Methods-CMPG323
This exercise for CMPG 323 is to source control the code of a solution that has had a big impact on my software development career.

## Explanation of code
This code demonstrates how a recursive method works using factorials. The program is programmed to work on the CMD. The program asks for and integer input from the user and will then call the factorial method with that input. The factorial method will then call itself with its parameter minus one, until zero is reached, in which case it will return the value 1 and all the recursively called factorial methods will return a value until the first method called returns the final value. The ansewr is displayed to the user.
